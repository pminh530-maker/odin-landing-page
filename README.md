# odin-landing-page
In this project, I applied some of the concepts that I've learned in HTML & CSS:
- Use the HTML boilerplate <!> and style the contents using external CSS
- Create and format elements (e.g. texts, links, images, buttons, content division elements etc.)
- Using flex boxes and their attributes to align contents on a page (e.g. flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, align-self, etc.) 
*Extra: I also learned that when "flex-direction" is "column", buttons often stretch themselves to the full width by default because of "align-self". To fix this, we only need to change "align-self" to "flex-start".
